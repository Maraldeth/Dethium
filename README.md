A minimalist Team Fortress 2 hud.

About
-------

A minimalist hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud.

It was originally created for myself as a fun side project to do while I wasn't doing schoolwork, but I've been asked by others to release it, so here it is. However, this is very much still under construction, and does NOT currently have any edits for MvM. This means that while MvM may still be playable, a lot of the features will either be not visible, or cut off.

To-Do List
--------

* nothing

Screenshots
--------
* coming soon

To Download
--------

Click the "ZIP" button with the cloud next to it in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download Zip` on Github. This will download `rayshud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract dethium into `custom` directory.
5. GG WP

The final structure should resemble the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── dethium
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        └── ...
```

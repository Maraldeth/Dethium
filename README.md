Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download`. This will download `rayshud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract dethium into `custom` directory.
5. GG

The final structure should resemble the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── dethium
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        └── ...
```
